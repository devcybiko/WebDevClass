     * The offered solution in the class slides
     * 
     * This is a pretty good solution as it terminates early
     * if the string is not a PanGram. So you have to do the math
     * or statistics to figure out how often the input is going
     * to be a non-pangram. 
     * 
     * In the grand scheme of things, it is likely that any sentence
     * is NOT going to be a PanGram - so iterating across the alphabet
     * looking for missing letters is a 'pretty good' solution.
     * 
     * However, using the letters in alphabetical order is likely
     * not the optimal way. You should consider the 'frequency of occurance'
     * of letters in English. IE: Start with 'z' since that is less
     * frequently used that 'a' or 'e'.
     * 
     * Also, most programmers consider 'str.includes()' to be "free"
     * or "instantaenous" - but it IS NOT. It iterates over the
     * string for you. So, if the str is VERY LONG and the letter that 
     * you're searching for appears at the VERY END, then this is going
     * to take longer than other solutions.
     * Consider a string like "........(1,000,000 dots go here)...abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".
     * In this case, the performace of str.includes() is going to take
     * 1,000,000 iterations to conclude that a letter is/isn't in the string.
